                    <p align="justify">Born and raised in New Jersey, I grew up spending much of my childhood at the beach and playing a lot of sports. Stayed in NJ for college at Rutgers, where I played division 1 football and studied kinesiology and computer science. After acheiving my bachelors, I moved to Denver to work on my Ph.D. in integrative physiology at the University of Colorado. Upon completing my Ph.D., I became a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, where I used state-of-the-art techniques in bioinformatics and molecular biology to determine the transducers of physical activity. I currently reside in Boston with my better half and work as a research scientist in the Data Science department for a tech company called WHOOP.</p>

                        <h3>Physiology</h3>
                        <p align="justify">I have a strong background in discovering novel aspects to physiology. My Ph.D. work uncovered a novel role for skeletal muscle and liver in regulating energy expenditure after weight loss and found that activating brown fat with cold exposure fails to beneficially impact energy expenditure during weight loss. As a post-doctoral fellow, I helped uncover the mechanisms behind acute and chronic exercise that confer the many benefits to exercise. In my industrial role at Whoop, I was the first to reveal the impact that COVID-19 vaccines had on the heart usign wearables, an extremely important finding as many government regulators expressed concern over the possible negative side-effects to new forms of vaccination.</p>

                        <h3>Machine Learning and Statistics</h3>
                        <p align="justify">In my pursuit to understand physiology, I have mastered and developed novel techniques in statistics and machine learning. During my Ph.D., I worked in the bioinformatics department at University of Colorado and developed a pipeline for transcriptome analysis, including developing a new method for performing pathway analyses to determine the networks of genes that are co-regulated by upstream factors. In my post-doctoral research, I helped leverage new ways to analyze multi-omics data to help decipher the mechanisms that drive benefits to exercise. Currently, I work in the field of wearable technologies and use state-of-the-art methods in machine learning to uncover novel physiology.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Programming, outside of statistical programming, is more of a passion than profession for me. I enjoy the puzzle of figuring out how to piece together different coding languages and theories of computer science to solve digital problems. Itâ€™s part of the reason why I developed this website! </p>
