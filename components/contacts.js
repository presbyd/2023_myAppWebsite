These species-specific differences are thought to occur within Müller cells; therefore, we used flow cytometry and transcriptomics to determine the transcriptional differences between retinal regeneration and reactive gliosis. We find that TGFβ3 is a candidate driver of these specific difference, which provides a potentially novel therapeutic target for different eye diseases."

We find that males reduce their body weight and food intake with exercise but females compensate for the energy expended by eating more."
